Development Setup -
1. Use go 1.13.x and use docker container for this

if no containers are already present -

$ docker run -v $(pwd):/helm --name helm3 -it golang:1.13 bash

or else use the existing container

$ docker start helm3
$ docker exec -it helm3 bash

To stop em

$ docker stop helm3

2. ALWAYS pull LATEST master version
3. ALWAYS REBASE with master whenever you are going to start coding. That is,
before you code anytime
4. See if you can increment the golang version in the CI/CD and anywhere
related to the repo. Increment to version 1.14.1 that is. Big change but not
gonna harm anyone I guess

what about --merge option?

if index.yaml is given, it will be converted to index object - OKAY

and then used to create both index.json and index.yaml - FINE

what about supporting merging with index.json ?

should we add another option called --merge-json ? or --merge-json-index ?

and how will this option work? as in, do we allow both --merge and --merge-json-index?
or just one at a time?

if we allow both, then we will have to convert both to index object, and then merge
all of them.

tests
- add test for index.json creation
- add test for merging with index.json given index.json to create
index.yaml
- add test for - only one of merge or merge json should be given, not both
- put it all in t.Run() or what? But it's all sequential, and shouldn't be parallel.
So I think this is okay? :)
- write test for load index.json file
- check test coverage for all the code you write
- check which json package to use
- write failure test cases?
- change help to reflect the new features regarding index.json

thoughts

1. What are the tests doing?

create temporary directory

link or copy 2 chart tar balls into it

run `helm repo index` command in the directory

load the created index.yaml

check the number entries in the index.yaml file

check the entries in the index.yaml file (a particular one)
- number of versions in the one entry
- what is the latest version (first version)

>>>>>>> I'm adding

load the created index.json

check the number entries in the index.json file

check the entries in the index.json file (a particular one)
- number of versions in the one entry
- what is the latest version (first version)

------

to test merge, remove first two tar balls

add a new chart and a new version in old chart

run command `helm repo index --merge index.yaml` in directory

load the created index.yaml

check the number entries in the index.yaml file

check the entries in the index.yaml file (a particular one)
- number of versions in the one entry
- what is the latest version (first version)

load the created index.json

remove index.yaml and test if merge works even when
inex.yaml does not exist

run command `helm repo index --merge index.yaml` in directory

load the created index.yaml

check the number entries in the index.yaml file

check the entries in the index.yaml file (a particular one)
- number of versions in the one entry
- what is the latest version (first version)

questions:
1. is it okay to use the default encoding/json package?
2. are these names okay?

flag name -> --merge-json-index

variable names -> destJSONIndex, jsonIndex, versionsInJSONIndex, 
expectedVersionInJSONIndex, indexForMergeJSON, 

function names -> WriteJSONFile, LoadIndexJSONFile, loadIndexJSON

--- 
okay, repo index kind of works now

other commands to check under helm repo -

add         Add a chart repository
index       Generate an index file given a directory containing packaged charts
list        List chart repositories
remove      Remove a chart repository
update      Update information of available charts locally from chart repositories

---

now for add, I need to see how to get index.json when it's present

If it's not present, then use index.yaml

questions
- what if index.json present but there's some parsing issue? ignore it and use
index.yaml ? ðŸ¤”
but hey, if we do that, then we are ignoring the bad data in index.json and
also ignoring index.json as a possible good source of truth and as a real
index. so, if it's present, only that will be used. any errors, we will throw it 
up as errors

same for any case, when json format is present, that alone will be used and
everything will be done to use it, and if there are errors, just error out

but we need to show the user what index is being used. right? through
logs may be

- what happens if a user is already using index.yaml ? I mean, that's the case
now. when do they start using the json? let's say it's provided by the chart
repository. so, if the chart repo is already added with yaml, keep using yaml?
or "upgrade" to json? may be for now, if it's already yaml, keep using yaml,
but when adding chart repo, if json is present, use json, and for updating too,
use json, and for search too use json. no yaml should be present. I mean, if parsing
is taking time, why even download it and parse it in the first place?

- also, how are we making use of the fact that json is easier to parse? the benchmark
uses a particular lib. should we use that for parsing json?

looks like `github.com/buger/jsonparser` is what core maintainers want to use

tasks:
1. rebase with master!
2. use go version 1.13.7

not able to rebase with master currently. this is because I introduced some
changes in the existing code. Let's not too much of that as much as possible.
Instead add a new test function and add to it. Later we can merge it all!

1. `$ helm repo index` command will create both index.yaml and index.json files
2. --merge-json-index will take up index.json, as a counterpart for --merge which takes index.yaml

discuss if this is needed. as json is a subset of yaml and every json is a valid
yaml, so --merge can take up a json too. And if we don't want to parse the json
differently (like fast and all), then we can just use --merge itself to get
the index.json

3. because of 2. only one of --merge or --merge-json-index can be used, NOT both

if 2 becomes invalid, this is invalid too :)

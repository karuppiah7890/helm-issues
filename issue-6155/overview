1. check about how index files are created / produced and anything related to that

- helm repo index command
- ?

2. check all the places where index files are used / consumed

- helm repo add command
- helm repo update command
- helm install command
- helm upgrade command
- helm repo list?
- helm repo remove?
- helm search

3. Finally, in repo_index_test.go - remove comment for t.Run() and 
join the other test function into a t.Run() . The current code is to avoid
any merge conflicts with master!

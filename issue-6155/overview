1. check about how index files are created / produced and anything related to that

- helm repo index command
- ?

2. check all the places where index files are used / consumed

- helm repo add command
- helm repo update command
- helm install command
- helm upgrade command
- helm repo list?
- helm repo remove?
- helm search
- what other commands / files to check?

3. Finally, in repo_index_test.go - remove comment for t.Run() and 
join the other test function into a t.Run() . The current code is to avoid
any merge conflicts with master!

4. Abstract out the JSON marshal and unmarshal features into a separate
package so that we can switch the JSON processing library anytime we want

5. Check what functions and methods are exposed and how to not expose them till
maintainers agree to it

6. check how this index.json repo index feature can help with bash
autocompletion that marc commented about - do check it out!

7. Check when to wrap errors and how to, and how to return. Check the PR code
then and make changes!

8. Debug logs for warning - for errors occurring due to index.json related issues

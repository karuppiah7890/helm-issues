# helm repo add command

1. need to add tests for downloading index.json if that's present, and NOT
download index.yaml

2. If any error occurs while downloading index.json - if it's 404 error, it's
okay, for any other failure - fail the whole thing, don't fall back to
index.yaml. Any other failure would mean - server errors (5xx), processing
errors after successfully downloading the index.json file

3. make sure that index.yaml is used if there's a 404 error for the index.json
file. should other client side errors (4xx) be considered too? ðŸ¤” check this out

4. pass these tests by writing actual code

details:
1. okay, I can see that there's a temporary server that's being run - an actual
server I guess, which hosts an index.yaml. At least that's what it looks like.
Now I need to be able to host an index.json too - but not always - I mean, I
should be able to tweak the way the server functions - as I want to be able to
test a server that only hosts index.yaml and then a server that hosts both
index.json and index.yaml. There WON'T be a case where the index.yaml won't be
hosted - because if that happens, that would be a breaking change - removing
an existing feature, without changing the major version of the software, as
any clients dependent on the server, that are still old and only know about the
index.yaml as an index will not be able to download the index then, if
index.json becomes the only index. So, we will not be writing any tests for that
breaking change case

And why do we need the tweak with both behavior for the server? the behaviors
being
* server hosting only index.yaml
* server hosting both index.yaml and index.json

this is so that both the scenarios can be tested, as we want index.json to be
used only if it's present, or else fallback to index.yaml - this will happen
in new versions of helm that is, with the server being old, only hosting
index.yaml but not index.json

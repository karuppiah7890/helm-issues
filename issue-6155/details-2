# helm repo add command

1. need to add tests for downloading index.json if that's present, and NOT
download index.yaml

2. If any error occurs while downloading index.json - if it's 404 error, it's
okay, for any other failure - fail the whole thing, don't fall back to
index.yaml. Any other failure would mean - server errors (5xx), processing
errors after successfully downloading the index.json file

3. make sure that index.yaml is used if there's a 404 error for the index.json
file. should other client side errors (4xx) be considered too? ðŸ¤” check this out

4. pass these tests by writing actual code

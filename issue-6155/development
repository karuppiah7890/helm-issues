Development Setup -
1. Use go 1.13.x and use docker container for this

if no containers are already present -

$ docker run -v $(pwd):/helm --name helm3 -it golang:1.13 bash
$ curl -sSfL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh \
-s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.24.0
$ cd /helm
$ make test # for all tests
$ make test-unit # for unit tests


or else use the existing container

$ docker start helm3
$ docker exec -it helm3 bash

To stop em

$ docker stop helm3

2. ALWAYS pull LATEST master version
3. ALWAYS REBASE with master whenever you are going to start coding. That is,
before you code anytime
4. See if you can increment the golang version in the CI/CD and anywhere
related to the repo. Increment to version 1.14.1 that is. Big change but not
gonna harm anyone I guess
